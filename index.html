			<h2>Things you shouldn't feel guilty about</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					If you think you’re bad at math because your always so slow, that might just be your dyslexia.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you find reading taxing because you always lose your spot (or any of the other dyslexic symptoms, like blurring, forgetting letters, reverse letters, or just misreading words), that’s not just you being stupid, that’s dyslexia.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you are horrible at grammar, but everyone tells you that isn’t dyslexia — it is, and it’s not your fault!
				</li>
				<li>
					If you always forget everything in short term or things like instructions—this is called working memory—you shouldn’t worry about it, you’r dyslexic, and that’s a symptom.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you have difficulty with pronouncing words or distinguishing what people are saying; can’t break words into sounds, you very well might be experiencing your dyslexia.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you can never find letters or words in large bodies of text, and find organization a pain, don’t stress out, it’s not your fault, it’s dyslexia.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>But what about strengths?!</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					If it’s easy for you to imagine things three-dimensionally, and it’s a normal part of you life, WOOHOOO—that’s a dyslexic strength! You wouldn’t be as good at it, if you could do it at all, without dyslexia!
